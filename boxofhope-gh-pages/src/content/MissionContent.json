  "title": "Our Mission",
  "text": "We are a group of engineering students from the University of Glasgow. Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, some of us still occasionally forget our cloth face-masks at home or totally lose track of when they need to be washed. Box of Hope solves this problem by sending push notifications if you leave your house without a mask and it tracks the usage over time. Most importantly, with the product being open source, anyone can contribute and learn valuable skills."
